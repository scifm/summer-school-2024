    "## What is DNA?\n",
    "\n",
    "**DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)** is the molecule that carries the genetic instructions for life. It is composed of two long strands that coil around each other to form a double helix. Each strand is made up of a sequence of nucleotides, which are the basic units of DNA. There are four types of nucleotides in DNA, distinguished by the nitrogenous bases they contain: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G).\n",

    "Source: https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Deoxyribonucleic-Acid\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **Double Helix Structure**: DNA's double helix is formed by two complementary strands that run in opposite directions.\n",
    "- **Nucleotide Composition**: Each nucleotide consists of a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base.\n",
    "- **Base Pairing**: Adenine pairs with thymine (A-T) and cytosine pairs with guanine (C-G) through hydrogen bonds.\n",
    "- **Genetic Information**: DNA stores genetic information that determines the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all living organisms and many viruses.\n",
    "- **Protein Synthesis**: DNA sequences (genes) are transcribed into RNA, which then directs the synthesis of proteins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is RNA?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)** is a single-stranded molecule involved in various roles within the cell, mainly related to the synthesis of proteins. RNA is similar to DNA but has some key differences: it contains the sugar ribose instead of deoxyribose, and the base uracil (U) replaces thymine (T).\n",

    "- **Types of RNA**:\n",
    "  - **mRNA (Messenger RNA)**: Carries the genetic information from DNA to the ribosome, where proteins are synthesized.\n",

    "- **Transcription**: The process of copying a segment of DNA into RNA.\n",
    "- **Translation**: The process where mRNA is decoded by ribosomes to produce a specific protein.\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is a Protein?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proteins** are large, complex molecules that play many critical roles in the body. They are made up of one or more chains of amino acids, which are linked together in a specific order determined by the sequence of nucleotides in the gene encoding the protein. Proteins are essential for the structure, function, and regulation of the body's tissues and organs.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Evolutionary conservation\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Sequence homology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_homology)** is the biological homology between DNA, RNA, or protein sequences, defined in terms of shared ancestry in the evolutionary history of life. Two segments of DNA can have shared ancestry because of three phenomena:\n",

    "2. Duplication events (paralogs)\n",
    "3. Horizontal (or lateral) gene transfer events (xenologs)\n",

    "Homology among DNA, RNA, or proteins is typically inferred from their nucleotide or amino acid **[sequence similarity](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3820096/)**. Significant similarity is strong evidence that two sequences are related by evolutionary changes from a common ancestral sequence. **[Alignments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment)** of multiple sequences are used to indicate which regions of each sequence are homologous. Computationally, this resembles the [Longest Common Subsequence](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-common-subsequence-dp-4/) (LCS) problem.\n",

    "### Understanding Match Score and Gap Penalty\n",
    "#### Match Score\n",
    "- Match Score: Points given when characters in two sequences match. Higher points indicate higher similarity.\n",
    "- Exact Match (x): Full points for identical characters (e.g., A vs. A might score +1).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gap Penalty\n",
    "- Gap Penalty: Points subtracted for inserting gaps in the alignment (these could represent **insertion** or **deletion** mutations)\n",
    "- Gap **Open Penalty**: Cost of starting a new gap.\n",

    "The dugong is a marine mammal on the vurnerable species list. It is one of four living species of the order Sirenia, which also includes three species of manatees. It is the only living representative of the once-diverse family Dugongidae; its closest modern relative, Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas), was hunted to extinction in the 18th century.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dugongs like coastal habitats that support seagrass meadows.\n",
